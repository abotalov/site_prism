Feature: Page Sections
  As a tester
  I want to be able to interact with element collections on a page
  In order to get and set values on the page

  Scenario: Designate a section of a page
    When I navigate to the home page
    Then I can see elements in the section
    When I navigate to another page
    Then that section is there too

  Scenario: section within a section
    When I navigate to the section experiments page
    Then I can see a section within a section

  Scenario: collection of sections
    When I navigate to the section experiments page
    Then I can see a collection of sections

  Scenario: sections visible on a page
    When I navigate to the home page
    Then the section is visible

  Scenario: get section's root element
    When I navigate to the home page
    Then I can get at the people section root element

  Scenario: Check that all elements are present
    When I navigate to the section experiments page
    Then all expected elements are present in the search results

  Scenario: Check we can call JS methods against a section
    When I navigate to the section experiments page
    Then I can run javascript against the search results

  Scenario: Wait for section element
    When I navigate to the section experiments page
    Then when I wait for the section element that takes a while to appear
    Then I successfully wait for the slow section element to appear

  Scenario: Anonymous sections
    When I navigate to the section experiments page
    Then Anonymous sections are recursive
    And Anonymous sections can be defined for collections of elements
